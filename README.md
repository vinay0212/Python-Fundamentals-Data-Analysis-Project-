# Python-Fundamentals-Data-Analysis-Project-
This project focuses on performing **data cleaning, transformation, and analysis** using Python. It begins with creating structured datasets for projects, employees, and seniority levels, then progresses through a series of tasks such as handling missing values, splitting and merging datasets, applying business logic, and calculating derived metrics like project bonuses. By simulating real-world scenarios such as promotions, demotions, and performance-based adjustments, the project demonstrates how raw data can be turned into meaningful insights through step-by-step data manipulation.

The implementation makes use of **Python** along with key libraries such as **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling, cleaning, and computation. Pandas was particularly useful for creating and merging DataFrames, handling missing values, and performing group-wise aggregations, while NumPy was applied for numerical operations. The entire workflow was developed and executed within a **Jupyter Notebook**, allowing clear organization of tasks with markdown explanations and code execution in a structured manner.

In conclusion, this project highlights how Python can be effectively used for **data preparation and business rule implementation**, turning multiple raw datasets into a unified, analysis-ready format. The step-by-step transformations—such as filling missing values, adding calculated fields, and restructuring employee details—showcase practical approaches that can be applied to real-world data processing pipelines. The final consolidated dataset not only provides valuable insights but also serves as a foundation for further visualization, reporting, or machine learning applications.
